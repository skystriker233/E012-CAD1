# E012-CAD1
Short description:
This is for CAD1 task1. An extra python file called mutibandCompressor.py is required for enhance.py and test.py. 
Some small changes were made to config.yaml. 
For E012, we just use the hybrid demucs model from baseline and we have improved remixing section by implementing a simple intelligent remixing system.
We changed the remix function in enhance.py. 
In order to run test.py, we moved the functions which are relevant to remix to test.py. 
To avoid long execution time, our system has been simplified.
